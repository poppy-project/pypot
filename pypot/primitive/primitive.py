class Primitive(StoppableThread):
    """ A Primitive is an elementary behavior that can easily be combined to create more complex behaviors.

        A primitive is basically a thread with access to a "fake" robot to ensure a sort of sandboxing. More precisely, it means that the primitives will be able to:

        * request values from the real robot (motor values, sensors or attached primitives)
        * request modification of motor values (those calls will automatically be combined among all primitives by the :class:`~pypot.primitive.manager.PrimitiveManager`).

        The syntax of those requests directly match the equivalent code that you could write from the :class:`~pypot.robot.robot.Robot`. For instance you can write::

            class MyPrimitive(Primitive):
                def run(self):
                    while True:
                        for m in self.robot.motors:
                            m.goal_position = m.present_position + 10

                    time.sleep(1)

        .. warning:: In the example above, while it seems that you are setting a new goal_position, you are only requesting it. In particular, another primitive could request another goal_position and the result will be the combination of both request. For example, if you have two primitives: one setting the goal_position to 10 and the other setting the goal_position to -20, the real goal_position will be set to -5 (by default the mean of all request is used, see the :class:`~pypot.primitive.manager.PrimitiveManager` class for details).

        Primitives were developed to allow for the creation of complex behaviors such as walking. You could imagine - and this is what is actually done on the Poppy robot - having one primitive for the walking gait, another for the balance and another for handling falls.

        .. note:: This class should always be extended to define your particular behavior in the :meth:`~pypot.primitive.primitive.Primitive.run` method.

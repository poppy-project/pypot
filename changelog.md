# Changelog

## V 2.11

## Features
* Add dummy motors (mostly for unittest)
* add native support for the pixl board
* allow to disable sensor at loading (convenient for camera sensor)
* add a dummy camera
* Add support for RX-24 dynamixel motors
* Add an event used to check if a "loopable" thread has been updated
* Move can now be plotted using matplotlib

### Snap
* Add blocs: “ping url <hostname>” and “set $robot host to <hostname>” which aim to fix DNS issues in some filtered networks.
* update “set <register> of motor(s) <motors> to value <value>” : speed register is now moving_speed instead of goal_speed. Able to use it through many motors at once now
* fix “get  <register> of motor(s) <motors>”
* fix some default values of inputs variable for consistency
* add entry for ik in SnapRemoteServer
* check return-delay-time at startup to prevent timeouts with misconfigured motors

## Bugfix
* many primitives threading issues
* python >= 3.4 compatibility issues
* setup unittest via dummy robot
* fix the unclear exception "Cannot unpack *values"
* fix cli tool `poppy-motor-reset` and rename it to `dxl-config`
* Fix deprecation issue in get_control_table
* Clear error when there is no "time script" in a v-rep scene
* Fix a freeze when stopping a paused primitive
* Fix offset/orientation issue in DummyController
* Fix hostname resolution

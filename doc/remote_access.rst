HTTP API
========

Pypot HTTP API has been designed to make it simple and efficient to connect pypot with other software platform (e.g. Scratch-like visual language) or for IoT where it allows you to have your robot communicate with the outside world: e.g. an external sensor, a twitter account, or even another robot. It also permits to simply bind pypot with any other language.

The exhaustive API is described here: http://docs.pypot.apiary.io with example of requests and responses.

Through this HTTP API, you can:

* access devices, meaning motor or sensor, and get/set their registers value
* access the existing group of devices
* interact with primitives: retrieve their list by status, call method, get/set properties
